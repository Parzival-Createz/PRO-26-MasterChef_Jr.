Instructions:

    1.>      In a pot pour 1/2 a can of coconut milk and 1/3 cup of sugar. Bring to a light simmer for 30 mins. You know it’s ready when the milk is reduced by half and it’s thick and almost transparent.
    2.>     Place in an airtight container after it has cooled down and store in freezer for 1 hour, (make sure it doesn’t freeze but it gets to a cool temperature) move it to the fridge when it’s cold and has reached the condensed milk consistency.
    3.>     Take 1 can of coconut milk from the fridge and pour into a mixer to beat the coconut milk until it is thick, fluffy and creamy.
    4.>     Add the ice cream mixture and mix until it gets to a fluffy whipped cream texture (2 mins).
    5.>     Add the flavoring of your choice and store in the freezer for at least 30 mins.
    6.>     Using a spatula, mix the ice cream base together with 3 tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder and 1/3 cup of hazelnuts.
    7.>     Scoop away and serve!
